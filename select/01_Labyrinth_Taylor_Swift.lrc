[00:17.66] It only hurts this much right now
[00:24.79] Was what I was thinking the whole time
[00:35.42] Breathe in, breathe through
[00:37.58] Breathe deep, breathe out
[00:42.38] I'll be getting over you my whole life
[00:52.46] You know how scared I am of elevators
[00:58.63] Never trust it if it rises fast
[01:04.93] It can't last
[01:11.43] 
[01:10.14] Uh oh, I'm falling in love
[01:14.67] Oh no, I'm falling in love again
[01:19.25] Oh, I'm falling in love
[01:22.59] I thought the plane was going down
[01:24.88] How'd you turn it right around
[01:39.88] 
[01:45.13] It only feels this raw right now
[01:52.26] Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
[02:02.60] Break up, break free, break through, break down
[02:09.77] You would break your back to make me break a smile
[02:20.08] You know how much I hate that everybody just expects me to bounce back
[02:32.51] Just like that
[02:39.51] 
[02:37.27] Uh oh, I'm falling in love
[02:41.80] Oh no, I'm falling in love again
[02:46.65] Oh, I'm falling in love
[02:49.94] I thought the plane was going down
[02:52.25] How'd you turn it right around
[03:07.25] 
[02:55.07] Uh oh, I'm falling in love
[02:59.27] Oh no, I'm falling in love again
[03:04.04] Oh, I'm falling in love
[03:07.37] I thought the plane was going down
[03:09.67] How'd you turn it right around
[03:24.67] 
[03:12.48] Uh oh, I'm falling in love
[03:16.63] Oh no, I'm falling in love again
[03:21.43] Oh, I'm falling in love
[03:24.78] I thought the plane was going down
[03:27.46] How'd you turn it right around
[03:42.46] 
[03:29.92] Uh oh, I'm falling in love
[03:34.27] Oh no, I'm falling in love again
[03:39.02] Oh, I'm falling in love
[03:42.26] I thought the plane was going down
[03:44.60] How'd you turn it right around
