Maybe you all sometimes experience this
The strange sensation overcomes you
As you dance
The low frequencies can't be heard
But felt
It hits your body over and over and over
The deeper it goes
Do you feel it?
Dance
This is low frequencies

This is low frequencies

Maybe you all sometimes experience this
The strange sensation that overcomes you
As you dance
The low frequencies can't be heard
But felt
It hits your body over and over and over
The deeper it goes
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
This is low frequencies
This is low frequencies
